## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager and runtime

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/momentum_finance_tracker.git
    cd momentum_finance_tracker
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts the Vite frontend development server and the Cloudflare Worker for the backend simultaneously.
    ```sh
    bun dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo-like structure within a single repository:

-   `src/`: Contains the frontend React application built with Vite.
    -   `pages/`: Main pages of the application.
    -   `components/`: Reusable React components, including shadcn/ui components.
    -   `stores/`: Zustand state management stores.
    -   `lib/`: Utility functions and API client.
-   `worker/`: Contains the Hono backend application that runs on Cloudflare Workers.
    -   `user-routes.ts`: Defines the API endpoints.
    -   `entities.ts`: Defines the data models and interaction logic with Durable Objects.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and mock data shared between the frontend and backend.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

-   **Frontend:** All frontend code resides in the `src` directory. Changes will trigger hot-reloading via Vite.
-   **Backend:** The Hono API is located in the `worker` directory. Routes are defined in `worker/user-routes.ts`. The local development server will automatically reload on changes.
-   **State Management:** Application state is persisted in a single Cloudflare Durable Object, which is abstracted away by `Entity` classes in `worker/entities.ts`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is designed for seamless deployment to the Cloudflare network.

1.  **Login to Cloudflare:**
    Ensure you have the Wrangler CLI installed and are logged into your Cloudflare account.
    ```sh
    bunx wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Deploy the application:**
    Run the deploy script, which builds the application and deploys it to your Cloudflare account.
    ```sh
    bun run deploy
    ```

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository with a single click.
